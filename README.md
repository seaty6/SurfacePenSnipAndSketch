# SurfacePenSnipAndSketch
An executable that emulates pressing Win+Shift+S to work around the Surface Pens limitations

The executable is just an Autohotkey script compiled into an exe with Ahk2Exe. 

# Usage:
Under whatever shortcut you want to launch the Snipping Tool, select "Launch a Classic app" and point it to [this executable](https://github.com/seaty6/SurfacePenSnipAndSketch/releases/download/v0.1/SnippingTool.exe)  (also found in the releases tab) after clicking "browse".
